- ..and more

## System Requirements

* Gnu/Linux
* OSX 10.13 or later
* Windows 7 or later

## Essential Dependencies

**Required:**
- Python >= 2.7 (no python >= 3)   
- wxPython >= 3.0

**Extra required:**
- ffmpeg >= 3.2
- ffprobe (for multimedia streams analysis) (can be built-in into ffmpeg)
- ffplay (media player for media preview) (can be built-in into ffmpeg)

**Optionals:**
- libx264 (has to be explicitly enabled when compiling ffmpeg)

- libfdk-aac (has to be explicitly enabled when compiling ffmpeg)
- libfdk-aac (has to be explicitly enabled when compiling ffmpeg)

## Use

- ***nix**: To start **videomass2** without installing in the system, simply run the "videomass2" file into 
unzipped sources folder, like this: `~$ python videomass2` or `~$ ./videomass2`. 
Be sure to check the execution permissions first.

- **Windows**: To start **videomass2** without installing in the system, unzip the Videomass2 sources 
folder that you just download, open a dos window and position you in the folder you just 
unzipped, then type: `python videomass2`


## Build Package

For building a redistributable package, using setup.py script in the sources folder.
There are several way to use it, this depends on the operating system used since each 
operating system has its own packaging tools. However, the common need tools and useful 
for simple python distibutions are *distutils* and *setuptools*.

- **distutils** is still the standard tool for packaging in python. It is included in the
standard library that can be easily imported.   

- **setuptools** which is not included in the standard library, must be
separately installed if not present in your system.
Update: setuptools is included from python 2.7

## Make a debian packages

If you want make a *.deb* binary package installable in your debian system and 
compatible with others debian-based systems, you need install those following tools: 
`~# apt-get update && apt-get install python-all python-stdeb fakeroot`. 
This installs all the need dependencies, including python-setuptools.   

Then, go into Videomass2 unzipped folder with your user (not root) and type:   
`~$ python setup.py --command-packages=stdeb.command bdist_deb`   
This should create a *python-videomass2_version_all.deb* in the new deb_dist directory, 
installable with `~# dpkg -i python-videomass2_version_all.deb` command.

See also [setup.py](https://github.com/jeanslack/Videomass2/blob/master/setup.py) 
script for insights.

## Make a Slackware package

Is available a SlackBuild script to build a package *.tgz* for Slackware and Slackware based 
distributions. 
See here [videomass.SlackBuild](https://github.com/jeanslack/slackbuilds/tree/master/Videomass2)

## MacOs

**As portable application (Run from sources code):**

You can run Videomass2 without install it, but make sure you have installed the following requests:

* WxPthon 3.0 (from homebrew)
* FFmpeg >= 3.2 (from hombrew)
* git

Then, clone the latest sources with git: `~$ git clone https://github.com/jeanslack/Videomass2`

or download Videomass2 sources at github site: <https://github.com/jeanslack/Videomass2>
and see [Use](#use)   

However, ffmpeg, ffprobe and ffplay must be installed in your system. 
Also, wxPython must be installed in your system.
You can install everything you need through homebrew: <https://brew.sh/>

If you want to get the ffmpeg, ffprobe and ffplay installers statically compiled and ready to install, you can download them at the following site:

<http://www.evermeet.cx/ffmpeg/>   
<http://www.evermeet.cx/ffprobe/>   
<http://www.evermeet.cx/ffplay/>

Note, however, that they may have limitations for reasons related to distribution (such as lack of AAC support)

**Build a OSX App**

If you have successfully performed the points described above, then you can try do the Videomass2 App for macOs.
For build the Videomass2.app there you need Xcode and command-line-tools available to the app store. 
Anyway, need following requirements:

* Xcode 
* Command-line-tools
* Python 2.7 from hombrew
* WxPython 3.0 from homebrew
* ffmpeg >= 3.2 (with ffprobe and ffplay also)
* Py2app installed with pip tools `sudo pip install py2app`

See the script setup.py for others information.

Open a terminal in the path where is setup.py and run the script with:   
    
    `~$ python setup.py py2app`   
    
If there are no errors, go to the dist folder and launch the application.   
If you want you can move the app to the * Applications * folder.   

If you get errors, probably  you need to create a virtual environment:   
    
<https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/>   
<https://wiki.wxpython.org/wxPythonVirtualenvOnMac>   
And then buld the standalone application for MacOs, here's something useful to read:   
<https://www.metachris.com/2015/11/create-standalone-mac-os-x-applications-with-python-and-py2app/>   
Note that on Videomass2 sources already exists a setup.py, then activate your virtual env and run setup.py:   
    
    `~$ python setup.py py2app` 

## Windows

**Notice!**:
Videomass2 do not include binaries/executables of the ffmpeg, ffprobe and ffplay.
If ffmpeg is not yet installed on your system please, download the compatible executable
of the FFmpeg for your Windows OS and set the pathname with Videomass2 setup dialog, otherwise
Videomass2 will not work.

**As portable application script (Run from sources code):**

- Download the latest release of the Python2.7 from 

<https://www.python.org/downloads/> and install it.

- Download the latest release of wxPython3.0 (.exe) toolkit for python 2.7 from:

<https://sourceforge.net/projects/wxpython/files/wxPython/3.0.2.0/> and install it.

- Download the Videomass2 sources from:

<https://github.com/jeanslack/Videomass2>

and see [Use](#use)   

**Make a .exe executable**

If you have successfully completed the points described above, now download and Install the **py2exe** utility for python 2.7 by:

<https://sourceforge.net/projects/py2exe/files/py2exe/0.6.9/>

if need update it and follow this how-to:

<https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2010/07/31/a-py2exe-tutorial-build-a-binary-series/>

Then open a dos window and position you in the Videomass2 folder you just unzipped and type:

`python setup.py py2exe`

A folder named 'dist' will be created where there will be the magic executable of Videomass2.exe
